Hi, my name is Stania Klegr. I’ve just finished my Master’s in Information Technology at the University of Waikato. A little bit of background about myself, I'm originally from Canada but have lived here in New Zealand since I was four. I was homeschooled until I started at the University of Waikato when I was 16. I am interested in all areas of computer science but am specifically passionate about game and mobile app development, computer graphics and networking. 

I’m currently looking for work in or around the Hamilton area, but I’m open to cool opportunities in other areas.
